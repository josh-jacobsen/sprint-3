1) What happens to the layout when the screen is resized to less than 550px? How does that work?

When the screen is resized to less than 550px across, all the boxes in the grid go from being side-by-side to being stacked up one on top of the other. This is achived by adjusting the width of the div from 48% (in the case of 2 boxes in a row, each with the same width), to 100% (meaning that the div now takes up all space on the row, as opposed to half of it)
